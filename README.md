Lunation
=================

A one page calendar website showing the different phases of the moon. The calculations were simplified so it is not 100% correct, but was made just for fun!

The default theme is "dark", but there's also a "light" and "warm" theme to choose - just click on the colored circles.

To view different calendar months, navigate with the arrows in the caption. Click on the month name to toggle the navigation for the year.

Hover or click on the moon picture to see the phase's name.
